Command:
gcc signal_handling.c -o signal_handling
Explanation:
This command compiles the C program that demonstrates signal handling using SIGTERM and SIGINT.

Command:
./signal_handling
Explanation:
The parent process runs indefinitely and waits for signals. One child sends SIGTERM after 5 seconds, and another child sends SIGINT after 10 seconds.

Concept:
The parent process handles each signal differently using custom signal handler functions and exits gracefully when a signal is received.
