Command:
gcc zombie_prevention.c -o zombie_prevention
Explanation:
This command compiles the C program that demonstrates zombie process prevention.

Command:
./zombie_prevention
Explanation:
The program creates multiple child processes using fork(). Each child exits after execution, and the parent process uses wait() to clean up terminated child processes.

Concept:
Zombie processes are prevented because the parent explicitly waits for each child process and prints the PID of the cleaned child.
